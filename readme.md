# Simulation of Heat Distribution in a Rod

In this project, the goal is to simulate the heat distribution in a rod of a specified length. The simulation is performed using the heat equation.

## Simulation Method

1. **Applying Heat to the Rod**: First, heat is applied to the rod for a duration of 10 seconds. This heat is modeled using the following function:
   $$洧녭(洧논,洧노) = 10洧노 \times \sin\left(\frac{洧랢洧논}{洧쯯\right)$$

2. **Simulating Heat Distribution**: After applying heat, the distribution of temperature in the rod is simulated up to a user-specified time using the heat equation.

## Solving the Heat Equation

To solve the heat equation, the method of separation of variables is used. We assume that the solution can be expressed as the product of two independent functions of the spatial variable (洧논) and the time variable (洧노):
$$u(洧논,洧노) = X(洧논)T(洧노)$$

By substituting this assumption into the heat equation and separating the variables, we obtain two ordinary differential equations:
$$\frac{1}{洧녦}\frac{d^2洧녦}{d洧논^2} = \frac{1}{洧띺^2洧녢}\frac{d洧녢}{d洧노} = -洧랝$$

where 洧랝 is a separation constant. These equations are solved as follows:

### Solving the Spatial Equation:
$$\frac{d^2洧녦}{d洧논^2} + 洧랝洧녦 = 0$$

With the boundary conditions 洧녦(0) = 0 and 洧녦(洧) = 0, the solution is:
$$洧녦(洧논) = \sin\left(\frac{洧녵洧랢洧논}{洧쯯\right)$$

### Solving the Temporal Equation:
$$\frac{d洧녢}{d洧노} + 洧띺^2洧랝洧녢 = 0$$

The solution to this equation is:
$$洧녢(洧노) = e^{-洧띺^2洧랝洧노}$$

### Combining the Solutions:
By combining the two solutions, the general solution to the heat equation is:
$$u(洧논,洧노) = \sum_{洧녵=1}^{\infty} 洧냢_洧녵 \sin\left(\frac{洧녵洧랢洧논}{洧쯯\right) e^{-洧띺^2\left(\frac{洧녵洧랢}{洧쯯\right)^2洧노}$$

### Determining the Coefficients $洧냢_洧녵$:
Using the initial condition $洧녹(洧논,0) = 100 \sin\left(\frac{洧랢洧논}{洧쯯\right)$, the coefficients $洧냢_洧녵$ are determined as follows:
- $洧냢_1 = 100$
- $洧냢_洧녵 = 0$ for $洧녵 \neq 1$

Thus, the final solution to the heat equation is:
$$u(洧논,洧노) = 100 \sin\left(\frac{洧랢洧논}{洧쯯\right) e^{-洧띺^2\left(\frac{洧랢}{洧쯯\right)^2洧노}$$

## Simulation Steps

1. **Input Parameters**: The thermal diffusivity (洧띺) and the length of the rod (洧) are obtained from the user.
2. **Discretizing the Rod**: The rod is divided into small segments.
3. **Calculating Temperature**: The temperature at each segment and at each time step is calculated using the heat equation.
4. **Graphical Representation**: The temperature distribution in the rod is displayed graphically.
